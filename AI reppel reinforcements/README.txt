SCRIPT EFFECT:
This script simply calls for reinforcements dropped by a helicopter right to your location immedeitely joining player's group and operate to the player's side!

NOTE
You can use this script in your mission infinitely but make DON'T spam it until atleast one operated helicopter fully completes its task, because this script user global variables so you can't spam at once.

IMPORTANT:
You must know that this script requires a mod named (advanced reppel) which will offer more immersion by making friendly AI's reppel from the heli instead of dismounting on ground.

and of course ENJOY!
